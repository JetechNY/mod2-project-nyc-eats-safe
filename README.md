WELCOME TO NYC EATS SAFE!

This app is intended to help Users make reservations, as well as  an added layer of protection for Covid-19 tracking. With this app, Users no longer have to repeatedly provide their personal information to restuarants, as the resturants will now have it through this app. Users can also flag if they've been tested postive for COVID or been in contact with someone that's been. Once a User has flagged this, the app will cancel all their upcoming reservations and notify the resturant. If the User had any reservations with a resturant within the past 14 days a notification will be posted on the resturant page. 

To Use the app: 
- Git clone app to your local machine 
- Bundle Install
- Pre-seeded information is provided. Please migrate and seed.
